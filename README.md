# Main goal (Level A)

Forecast when the engine is due to maintenance
Predict the remaining useful life of test partition observations, based on the models
calibrated with the training data. You know that in the training partition, the engine runs
until failure. That means, the maximum operating cycle for a unit +1 was the failure
operation. Make four prediction models and predict the remaining useful life for the test
partition, using the model calibrated with the training data partition.
Note: You need all four operational settings datasets, both training and testing partitions
for this task.


# Week 2

In this week, you will be getting familiar with the data.  
At the end of the week, the goal is to have:
- Clean data
- Efficiently imported into your workspace
- Visualized
- An understanding of what the data is used for  

The PDF you will return will have **max. 2 pages**.

## Breakdown of the points

- [Yes] **0.25p** – an established communication channel and appropriate strategy for code sharing.  
- [Asi?] **0.25p** – data correctly imported into appropriate matrices completely: observations as rows, variables (predictors) as columns.  
- [ ] **0.5p** – identification of challenges of the data (e.g. time series not synchronized, missing values, extra variables, unknown physical meanings, etc.).  
- [ ] **0.5p** – a visualization and comment on the dataset (variable distribution, number of observations, type of measurements – time series or not).  
- [ ] **3p** – exploratory data analysis with PCA: explain variable correlations and visualize the PCs using biplots, loading plots.(*only on the X matrix – we are not looking at the response variable now*)  
- [ ] **0.5p** – identification of pretreatment steps, and a plan on how to do data pretreatment.

# Week 3–4 (15.09 - 28.09)
## Data Pretreatment and Modelling Plan

Based on your initial evaluation, the received feedback and the strategies of other groups, perform **data pretreatment**.  
There will be a **max. 2 pages** addition to your project PDF.

## Breakdown of the points – Data Pretreatment

- [ ] **0.5p** – feedback incorporation and adjustment of the initial pretreatment plan  
- [ ] **0.5p** – data centering and scaling techniques  
- [ ] **0.5p** – evaluation of extreme/missing values and mitigating actions, data synchronization (for time series), sampling  
- [ ] **0.5p** – visualizing pretreated data

## Modelling Plan

Make a modelling plan for your modelling goal. Create a **flowchart** of the operations needed to accomplish the task, and assign roles to the team members for each step.  

The start of each flowchart should be the **cleaned data**, and the end of it should be the **modelling goal achieved**.  
If there is more than one modelling goal, the flowchart can take multiple paths.  
There will be a **max. 2 pages** addition to your project PDF.

## Breakdown of the points – Modelling Plan

- [ ] **0.5p** – modelling goal (What is the purpose of your data analysis?)  
- [ ] **0.5p** – model calibration strategy: tools used, methodology, data used  
- [ ] **0.5p** – model validation strategy: scope of validation, methodology  
- [ ] **0.5p** – model testing strategy: metrics and data used  
- [ ] **0.5p** – description of the mathematical methods used in modelling  
- [ ] **0.5p** – model diagram / operations flowchart
